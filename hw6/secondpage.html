        <h1>A Story</h1>
        <p>The world's most infuriatingly handsome dragon strolls into the grove. He has perfectly symmetrical washboard abs. Every muscle is chiseled like it was crafted by a team of artists. His apparel is chosen to subtly accentuate his features, but he clearly doesn't need it. His feathers are tousled in a way that seems artful rather than wind-blown. People look at him and want to strangle him on sight for being irritatingly handsome.</p>

        <p>Behind him scurries an array of silks and satins that might resemble a dragon.</p>

        <p>"I still think this isn't worth the discounts..."</p>
        <p>Bulwark shoots a wink at another dragon with a magical pearl, as the reflection in the pearl changes to something that glows with unbearable brightness. Chevonne nudges him.</p>
        <p>"Stop that! You'll get us kicked out!"</p>
        <p>"Aw, you don't appreciate my shining personality~?"</p>
        <p>"I appreciate the fact that you will be delivering the worms directly into my claws and nothing more." Chevonne's expression as she returns the nod appears to be an attempt to telepathically convey her desire to find the worms and leave as soon as physically possible.</p>
        <p>Bulwark sweats nervously in the background, unnoticed by Chevonne. He lied about the worms. There are no worms here, especially not discounted worms, and he will be in big trouble as soon as she discovers that.</p>
